# Software Management Plan in SciWiz

[**SciWiz**](https://sciwiz.lumc.nl/) is the LUMC’s instance of the platform that provides the SMP template as an
interactive online form. You can log in, create a project, and step through the questions at your own pace. SciWiz provides a flexible approach to standardizing software management across LUMC, while also accommodating diverse project needs.

> Note: SciWiz is currently only accessible via the LUMC network.

## How to create an SMP

1. Access [SciWiz](https://sciwiz.lumc.nl/).
    - Go to [sciwiz.lumc.nl]((https://sciwiz.lumc.nl/)). 
    - Log in or create an account using your LUMC email address.
2. Create a new project
    - Once logged in, in the left-hand navigation bar, click **Projects**.
    - Click **Create** (top right).
    - Enter the name of your software project.
    - Select the following Knowledge Model: “LUMC-DCC Software Management Plan”.
    - When prompted to select Question Tags, you can filter questions according to your project’s complexity, see [Management levels](#management-levels) for more details.
    - Click **Create** to start.
3. Write the SMP by answering questions. You can save your progress at any time and return later to complete it. You can also invite collaborators.

The **Research Software best practices** section of this guideline roughly maps onto the questions in the SMP and is designed to help you think about your project and fill out the questions efficiently.

## Management levels

The SMP uses three management levels—A, B and C—to adjust the questions according to management needs, with A being the lowest level and C the highest.

| Level | Typical software | Expected rigour |
|---|---|---|
| **A — personal / one-off** | A script or notebook for one paper | Repository, license, purpose, maintainership, minimal reproducibility notes |
| **B — project / shared** | A reusable pipeline, package, workflow or tool used by a group | Documentation, testing, citation, packaging, dependency management, maintenance plan |
| **C — critical / institutional** | Software used in production, by external users, or in clinical/institutional contexts | Full governance, monitoring, security, auditability, support contracts, robust continuity |

When creating a project in SciWiz, you can hover over a management level tag to see its description and applicability.

Starting too low is risky: the project may grow before the basics are in place. Starting higher than needed may cost a little extra time, but it usually prevents worse work later. In SciWiz (the platform that hosts the SMP), the level you choose acts as a filter on the question set; you will only see questions tagged for your level and below. The level cannot be changed later, so choose carefully. If you are unsure, select the higher level.

## Answering questions at different project phases

Each question in the SMP is assigned a project phase. This determines whether you describe future plans or current practice.

**Project phases and expectations**

- **Ideation** and **Planning**—describe the *intended* or planned state.
- **Active development**—provide *concrete details*: real URLs, files, tools, and named responsibilities.
- **Maintenance**—focus on *changes over time*: releases, deprecations, maintainer updates, and support status.

**How to read and answer the questions**

For consistency, questions are written in the present tense.
In early project phases, read **"Does the project…"** as **"Does or will the project…"**.

Do not answer with terms such as **"planned"** or **"not yet implemented"**. Instead, answer the question directly and describe the intended setup. The project phase already indicates whether you are describing current practice or future plans.

## A note on regulated software

The SMP is **not** a substitute for the regulatory documentation that medical-device or in-vitro-diagnostic software must produce. It can sit alongside such documentation, but it cannot replace the artefacts required for Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), IVD software, clinical decision-support tools, or software developed under a formal quality-management system (ISO 13485, IEC 62304, ISO 14971, MDR, IVDR, etc.).

If your software produces or influences a clinical recommendation, triages patients, is embedded in a regulated device, or is otherwise covered by a sectoral regime, flag this in the General chapter and contact <LUMC legal> early. Treat the SMP as a high-level overview that complements, not replaces, your regulated documentation.

## A note on data: the SMP does not replace the DMP

The LUMC SMP touches on data only insofar as software *handles* it. Details about legal basis, retention, consent, and storage of personal data belong in the LUMC Data Management Plan, not here. The Risks chapter only flags that the software has a relationship with sensitive data and points to the corresponding DMP.
